i made my result without any failure. I also got my self in the competetion between many school and with every thing our school was crowned second with second position.
I love writting letters and i alsolove to know what is happen around me.Writting has always give me joy. When i wanted to enter KWASU, my course of chioce was mass communiction
and that was because in wanted to be a Reporter in life, but life knows what is best for me so KWASU gave me admission into Library and Information Science<LIS>.I was happy i was given
admission even though i don't like the course but gadually, i start liking the course.
<p>The final competition i went for before i left my school was the happiest thing have doneas a child, as a student and as a leader to make my parent, my teacher, and my collegue happy.
After i am given LIS, i now want to be a great Libraian and wannted to work in the National Library in Abuja or work as a librarian in the Academic Library i.e University Library.
